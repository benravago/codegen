At the moment, this project just contains script to build the minimal subset of the [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) library needed to support the Nashorn javascript engine in [NinJa](https://github.com/benravago/ninja).
I would, eventually, like to put together an alternative with a Fluent API; maybe like [jitescript](https://github.com/qmx/jitescript).
